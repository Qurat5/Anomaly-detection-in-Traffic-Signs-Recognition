# Anomaly-detection-in-Traffic-Signs-Recognition

 # Installation Guide
This guide covers setting up and installing the code for anomaly detection in traffic signs recognition.

# Requirements
The code has been developed and tested on Python 3.7. The following packages are required:

PyTorch >= 1.7  
OpenCV  
Albumentations  
Matplotlib  
NumPy  
An NVIDIA GPU is strongly recommended for model training.
